 goliath.1.desc:0 "Among the valuable data obtained from the precursor archives on §H[Root.GetName]§!, our scientists uncovered something that shocks them and contradicts everything we knew about the precursor race - a concept warship design of gigantic proportions\n\nWhile an Escort is nimble, a Battlecruiser versatile and a Titan packs firepower, this new design, §HGoliath§!, seems to serve no other purpose than being big. We do not yet understand why the precursor felt this was a good idea at some point during the Great Crusade.\n\nDue to its size and its challenges posed to even the finest engineers in the galaxy, the development of §HGoliath§! was abandoned. Records indicate that several scientists felt it was impractical, and found it vulnerable if they did not have naval superiority - which they did not. In addition, the §HGoliath§! would be vulnerable to primitives that fielded thousands of corvettes armed with nothing but red lasers.\n\nNevertheless the calculations to power this enormous ship seems to check out. With our current ability in engineering, this project is one that is within our capabilities, if a bit unnecessary."
 goliath.1.a:0 "This sounds like a worthy challenge."
 goliath.1.b:0 "No. The design clearly proves that the precursors were insane."
