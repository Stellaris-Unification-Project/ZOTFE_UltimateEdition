START_SCREEN_POST_ORIGINAL_PEOPLE:0 "For centuries, [GetAdj] scientists knew the first [GetSpeciesNamePlural] did not in fact evolve from the biosphere of [GetHomeWorldName], and there were simply no records of [GetSpeciesName] existence until thousands of years ago. This led to a popular theory - that [GetSpeciesNamePlural] perhaps originated from a once great spacefaring empire.\n\nBut if we were already a spacefaring civilization at some point, why did the first [GetSpeciesName] colonists inherit none of the advanced technologies, and why were we left here and seemingly forgotten? Where did [GetSpeciesNamePlural] come from and what happened to the others? Why did our ancestors make no mention of their past?\n\nIn recent years, [GetRulerTitle] [GetRulerName] has risen to power with thunderous applause, promising to look to the stars and find the answers to the mysterious [GetAdj] past once and for all."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_Aryan_Republic_desc:0 "For generations, the Aryans have lived on the idyllic countryside of their homeworld, eating sausages, and built a pacifistic society that championed freedom, individual rights and scientific progress - if only to develop more efficient ways of making and eating sausages.\n\nTheir love for rules and beer largely prevented the society from asking too many questions, specifically, their true origins or their distant past, of which no records can be found anywhere on the planet. For historians, perhaps the answers can only be found among the stars, and the secrets to their past will at last be unveiled. Or perhaps it's just time for one more beer."
