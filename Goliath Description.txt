[i]Once upon a time, an eager fan asked a Modder if he would make him a giant battlecruiser. The disappointed fan never received an answer, and so he went on to make The Zenith of Fallen Empires, where he can be reunited with his one true love, and tells himself at last that he has been a good boy and deserves the biggest toy. And this is how Goliath was born.[/i]


The Zenith of Fallen Empires: Goliath Awakened allows Ascended Empires to construct a massive warship to add to their precious fleet. Inspired by die Ratte Landkreuzer, this mod imagines that at one point in the Great Crusade, the precursors planned to build a giant warship that was later deemed too impractical and too costly to produce, and the project was abandoned in order to direct the resources to more vital parts of the war effort. This is an add-on component mod to [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1317022177]The Zenith of Fallen Empires 2.0[/url] and note that this mod requires the base mod to run.
