[i]In our quest to engineer perfection, we created Utopian worlds, worlds that redefine beauty across the known galaxy.  Visitors flock to these worlds to experience these wonders of the universe, and fall in love. In our arrogance, we built Utopian cities on these worlds, showed them the strength of our empire and our superior way of life. In pursuing a place on the history archives, we found ourselves at the pinnacle of societal evolution. But that was also the beginning of the end.[/i]

The Zenith of Fallen Empires: Utopian Paradise is the culmination of your empire¡¦s ascension and quest to create Utopian Worlds, where labour is optional and your citizens can live the rest of their lives in bliss. In engineering these wonders of the universe, Ascended Empires found themselves distracted from their original goals, giving rise to Hedonism in their society and eventual decadence. This is an add-on component mod to [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1317022177]The Zenith of Fallen Empires 2.0[/url] and note that this mod requires the base mod to run.
