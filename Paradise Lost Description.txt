[i]And so the cycle began once more and the galaxy was plunged into darkness. The Great Crusade was repeating before our eyes. When we heard of the naval disaster at Alpha Centuri, our spirits remained unbroken. Even when our Enemy's armada rained hellfire upon our core worlds and millions perished, that did not faze me, for each of us truly believed we were the chosen people. But when news of our government's surrender were broadcasted, that was what broke me. Our glorious empire, burned down by infidels and traitorous leaders, broke our hearts and our people. We were an Ascended Empire no more. But we will fight again. No matter how many times we were beaten down, we will rise from the ashes and our Enemy will answer for what they have done.[/i]


The Zenith of Fallen Empires: Paradise Lost depicts the final chapter for your journey as a once-proud Ascended Empires - your downfall. This mod imagines that through wars with other Ascended Empires or voluntary means, an Ascended Empire will inevitably decline from the height of its power and become a shadow of its former self. This is an add-on component mod to [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1317022177]The Zenith of Fallen Empires 2.0[/url] and note that this mod requires the base mod to run.
